# Hangman Game
## Coded in March 2020

The game is simple! You chose:
* The number of players
* The number of lives
..and you supply the letters to guess!
* __Good luck!__

#### A Note on Running Static Files

If the user does not want to unzip the relevant (for windows or mac operating systems) zip folders with the self-contained full game as click-to-execute, fully-bundled software, then use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the downloaded folder in your terminal or powershell application.
2. Type the `./` prefix before the approprriate file, located within the project folder, depending on your operating system. For example, please use the command `./hangman_game` for running on Mac, or `./hangman_game.exe` for running on Windows.
